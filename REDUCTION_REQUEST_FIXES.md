# Reduction Request System - Fixes Implemented

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Doctors Not Seeing Reduction Requests**
- **Problem**: Doctors couldn't see reduction requests in the case view
- **Root Cause**: Reduction requests weren't being properly loaded for each referral
- **Solution**: Modified `CasesController::getReferrals()` to individually load reduction requests for each referral

### 2. **Missing Counter Offer Display**
- **Problem**: Doctor's counter offers weren't visible to doctors
- **Root Cause**: Counter offer data wasn't being properly processed and displayed
- **Solution**: Enhanced data processing to ensure all reduction request fields are properly set

### 3. **Incomplete UI for Each Referral**
- **Problem**: Reduction requests weren't properly displayed for each referral in case view
- **Root Cause**: UI component wasn't handling the nested data structure correctly
- **Solution**: Completely redesigned the reduction request display in case view

### 4. **Missing Doctor Response Forms**
- **Problem**: Doctors couldn't respond to reduction requests directly from case view
- **Root Cause**: Response forms were only available in the dedicated reduction requests page
- **Solution**: Added inline response forms for doctors in the case view

## Technical Changes Made

### Backend Fixes

#### **CasesController.php**
```php
// Enhanced getReferrals method to load reduction requests individually
private function getReferrals($user, $case): array
{
    // ... existing code ...
    
    // Load reduction requests for each referral individually
    if (!empty($referrals)) {
        foreach ($referrals as &$referral) {
            // Get reduction requests for this specific referral
            $reductionRequests = \App\Models\ReductionRequest::where('referral_id', $referral['referral_id'])
                ->orderBy('created_at', 'desc')
                ->get()
                ->toArray();
            
            $referral['reduction_requests'] = $reductionRequests;
            
            // Process reduction request details and file links
            if (!empty($referral['reduction_requests'])) {
                foreach ($referral['reduction_requests'] as &$reductionRequest) {
                    if (isset($reductionRequest['file_path']) && $reductionRequest['file_path']) {
                        $reductionRequest['file_link'] = asset('storage/' . $reductionRequest['file_path']);
                    }
                    // Ensure all fields are properly set
                    $reductionRequest['counter_offer'] = $reductionRequest['counter_offer'] ?? null;
                    $reductionRequest['notes'] = $reductionRequest['notes'] ?? null;
                    $reductionRequest['doctor_decision'] = $reductionRequest['doctor_decision'] ?? 'pending';
                    $reductionRequest['referral_status'] = $reductionRequest['referral_status'] ?? 'pending';
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return $referrals;
